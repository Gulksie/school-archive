    "In this assignment you will be implementing a set of functions used in conjunction to form a website login system. Your system will utilize a text file for storing, retrieving, and verifying user credentials. We identify users based on their **username** and **password**. For simplicity we assume that usernames and passwords only contain alphanumeric characters. Alphanumeric characters represent the numbers **0-9** and the letters **A-Z** (both uppercase and lowercase). Usernames and passwords are case sensitive and must contain **at least 6** characters. Usernames must be unique.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each username and password combination will be stored on its own line in the text file. Each line in the text file has the following format:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "  \\texttt{username\\tpassword\\n}\\tag{1}\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "More explicitly, each line in the text file will contain a user’s username, a tab character, and that user’s password followed by the newline character. Please note that when opening the text file for viewing you will not explicitly see the **\\t** and **\\n** characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In your implementation, usernames and passwords will be stored as plain text. This means that all usernames and passwords can easily be compromised if access to the text file is provided. This is extremely dangerous in the real world and poses huge security issues. In practicality, passwords are encrypted before stored so that they are not easily identifiable in the event of a data breach. Thus, please do not use any real passwords when developing and testing your program. \n",

Please ensure that your functions have the EXACT naming as specified! Failure to do so will result in lost marks.\n",

    "    - Opens a file with the name *filename* for reading.\n",
    "    - Initializes two empty lists: **usernames**, and **passwords**\n",
    "    - Iterates through each line in the file and extracts the username and password in each line. On each iteration, the username is appended as a string to **usernames** and the password is appended as a string to **passwords**. Thus, after each line in the file has been iterated, **usernames[i]** and **passwords[i]** will contain the username and password for a given user at a given index i\n",

    "3. Define a function **createUser**(*username*, *password*, *filename*):\n",

The decrypt() function could then be used in login(), to decrypt the password retrived from the database. Alternativley, the user input could be encrypted, and that can be compared to the stored encrypted password. This is similar to how passwords are stored in real world contexts, however they use complex salting and hashing algorithms rather than encryption. \n",
