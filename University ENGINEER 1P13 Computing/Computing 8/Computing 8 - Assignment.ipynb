    "\n",
    "Object oriented programming languages are often used when designing and developing complex systems such as video games. Objects are used to represent various aspects of the game such as players, enemies, items, maps, etc. **Role-playing** video games are a common genre of video games where users control the actions of a player or character. These games often involve some form of combat in addition to the player having attributes such as health, levels, damage, etc. In this assignment, you will be implementing a **Player** class for a video game. Our player class will keep track of the following features:\n",
    "\n",
    "-\tThe player’s name\n",
    "-\tThe player’s health\n",
    "-\tThe player’s current level\n",
    "-\tThe player’s current “score”\n",
    "-\tThe score required to reach the next level\n",
    "-\tThe player’s set of attacks\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the **Player** class, you will be implementing a function that will use the **Player** class. Please thoroughly read the requirements section to understand how to implement the methods and function!"
