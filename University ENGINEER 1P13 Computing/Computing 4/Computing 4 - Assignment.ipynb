    "In this assignment you will be implementing a product verification system for a company that manufactures smartphones. Your system will determine if a given smartphone passed quality assurance testing in order for the smartphone to be deemed sellable on the market.\n",
    "\n",
    "All smartphones undergo two quality assurance tests, namely **T1** and **T2**. The product and testing information will be provided to your system in a **list of lists** where each sub-list represents a unique product accompanied with its T1 and T2 test scores and test dates. Each sub-list has the following format:\n",

    "1. It is not necessary to use a for loop. This is because each data set contains a known constant amount of tests, meaning that the array can just be indexed with integers outside of a for loop. It is benificial to use a for loop because it would make the transition to a system where the number of tests are unknown significantly easier. I would handle that scenario by using a for loop to access each tests (# of tests = length(data point) - 1), check if the test is passed, and use boolean logic (and statment) to add that to our existing passed state.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. It is possible to emulate any for loop with a while loop. In this case, an index varible would have to be kept that stores the current poisition in the array, increment that varible every loop, and use that index to take elements from the product array. In this scenario, there is no benifit to using a while loop. A possible scenario where a while loop would be benificial is when there is an infinite amount of phones to test. In this case, the while loop would be done as previously stated, but the list of passed products would be printed every x amount of loops (x is any number)\n",
